Task 1 - Counting Down with Loops
Write a Python program to create a countdown timer.

Ask the user for a starting number.
Use a while loop to print numbers from that number down to 1.
When the countdown ends, print a celebratory message like "Blast off!"
For example:

Enter the starting number: 5
5 4 3 2 1 Blast off! ðŸš€
"""
starting_num = int(input("Enter the starting number: "))
while starting_num > 0:
    print(starting_num)
    starting_num -= 1
print("Blast off!")

"""
Task 2 - Multiplication Table with for Loops
Write a program that generates the multiplication table for any number provided by the user.

Ask the user to input a number.
Use a for loop to print the multiplication table for that number (from 1 to 10).
Example Output:

Enter a number: 4
4 x 1 = 4 4 x 2 = 8 ... 4 x 10 = 40
"""
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
for num in range(1, 11):
    print(f'{number} * {num} = {number * num}')

"""
Task 3 - Find the Factorial
Write a Python program to calculate the factorial of a number entered by the user.

Ask the user for a number.
Use a for loop to calculate the factorial.
Print the result in a friendly format.
For example:

Enter a number: 5
The factorial of 5 is 120.
"""
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
result = number
for i in range(number-1, 0, -1):
    result *= i
print(f"The factorial of {number} is {result}.")
